    "<p>Whether or not you like football, the Super Bowl is a spectacle. There is a little something for everyone at a Super Bowl party. Drama in the form of blowouts, comebacks, and controversy for the sports fan. There are the ridiculously expensive ads, some hilarious, others gut-wrenching, thought-provoking, and weird. The half-time shows with the biggest musicians in the world, sometimes <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ZD1QrIe--_Y?t=14\">riding giant mechanical tigers</a> or <a href=\"https://youtu.be/mjrdywp5nyE?t=62\">leaping from the roof of the stadium</a>. It is a big show! In this notebook, I am going to find out how some of the elements of this show interact with each other. After exploring and cleaning the data a little, I am going to answer questions like:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>What are the most extreme game outcomes?</li>\n",
    "<li>How does the game affect television viewership?</li>\n",
    "<li>How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time?</li>\n",
    "<li>Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
